# Feed Reader Testing Project

This project is part of Udacity's Front End Nanodegree Scholarship.
Given a static webpage, the task was to convert it to a mobile ready web app by:
* Making the page responsive (done using flexbox and media queries)
* Addressing accessibility of the page
* Adding a service worker to cache the page so it is avaiable offline

## Installing from source

1. Clone the following repo:
 * git clone https://github.com/oc266/Restaurant-Review-Project
2. Create a server using python by cd'ing into the folder then typing `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` if you have Python 2.x or `python -m http.server 8000` if you have Python 3.x.
3. Open localhost:8000 on your browser of choice to run the application

## Built with the help of:
* Starter code provided by Udacity (https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader)
* The lessons on service workers on Udactiy, which inspired the code for the service worker in this project (https://eu.udacity.com/course/offline-web-applications--ud899)
